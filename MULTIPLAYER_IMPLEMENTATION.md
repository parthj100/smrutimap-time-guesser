# SmrutiMap Multiplayer Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of multiplayer functionality for SmrutiMap, a historical photo guessing game. The implementation includes a Kahoot-style real-time multiplayer system with room-based gameplay, real-time synchronization, and comprehensive UI components.

## Architecture

### Database Schema
The multiplayer system uses four main tables in Supabase:

#### 1. `multiplayer_rooms`
Stores multiplayer game room information:
- `id`: UUID primary key
- `code`: 6-character alphanumeric room code for joining
- `name`: Human-readable room name
- `host_id`: Reference to the host participant
- `status`: Room status ('waiting', 'playing', 'finished')
- `max_players`: Maximum number of players allowed
- `current_players`: Current number of players (auto-updated by triggers)
- `settings`: JSON object with game configuration
- `created_at`, `started_at`, `finished_at`: Timestamps

#### 2. `room_participants`
Tracks players in each room:
- `id`: UUID primary key
- `room_id`: Reference to multiplayer room
- `user_id`: Reference to authenticated user (nullable for guests)
- `display_name`: Player's chosen display name
- `role`: Player role ('host', 'player', 'spectator')
- `status`: Connection status ('connected', 'disconnected', 'ready')
- `avatar_color`: Hex color for visual identification
- `joined_at`, `last_seen`: Timestamps

#### 3. `multiplayer_sessions`
Active game sessions:
- `id`: UUID primary key
- `room_id`: Reference to multiplayer room
- `current_round`: Current round number
- `total_rounds`: Total rounds in the game
- `current_image_id`: Current image being played
- `status`: Session status ('waiting', 'round_active', 'round_results', 'game_finished')
- `images`: Array of image IDs for the session
- `round_start_time`, `round_end_time`: Round timing

#### 4. `multiplayer_round_results`
Individual round results for each participant:
- `id`: UUID primary key
- `session_id`: Reference to multiplayer session
- `participant_id`: Reference to room participant
- `round_number`: Round number
- `year_guess`, `location_guess_lat`, `location_guess_lng`: Player's guesses
- `year_score`, `location_score`, `total_score`: Calculated scores
- `time_taken`: Time to submit guess in seconds
- `submitted_at`: Timestamp

### Database Functions
Several PostgreSQL functions support multiplayer operations:

1. **`generate_unique_room_code()`**: Generates unique 6-character room codes
2. **`get_multiplayer_game_images(image_count)`**: Returns random image IDs for game sessions
3. **`cleanup_expired_rooms()`**: Removes old unused rooms
4. **`update_room_player_count()`**: Trigger function to maintain accurate player counts

### Row Level Security (RLS)
Comprehensive RLS policies ensure proper access control:
- Players can only view/join active rooms
- Users can only modify their own participant records
- Host-only operations (room management, game starting)
- Participants can only access their room's data

## Frontend Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. **MultiplayerGame** (`src/components/multiplayer/MultiplayerGame.tsx`)
Main orchestration component that manages the multiplayer flow:
- Routes between menu, lobby, and game views
- Integrates with `useMultiplayerGame` hook
- Handles error states and loading

#### 2. **MultiplayerMenu** (`src/components/multiplayer/MultiplayerMenu.tsx`)
Three-view menu system:
- **Main Menu**: Create or join room options
- **Create Room**: Full game configuration with mode selection
- **Join Room**: Simple room code entry interface

Features:
- Mobile-responsive design
- Form validation
- Random guest name generation
- Game mode presets (Classic, Blitz, Marathon)

#### 3. **RoomLobby** (`src/components/multiplayer/RoomLobby.tsx`)
Comprehensive lobby interface:
- Real-time participant list with avatar colors
- Room information panel with game settings
- Ready status tracking with progress bar
- Host controls for game management
- Room code sharing functionality
- Connection status indicators

### State Management

#### **useMultiplayerGame** Hook (`src/hooks/useMultiplayerGame.ts`)
Comprehensive state management for multiplayer functionality:

**Key Features:**
- Supabase Realtime channel management for rooms, game events, and chat
- WebSocket connection handling with heartbeat monitoring
- Room creation/joining with proper error handling
- Real-time event processing for all multiplayer events
- Automatic reconnection and presence tracking

**Public API:**
```typescript
const {
  gameState,           // Current multiplayer state
  createRoom,          // Create new room
  joinRoom,           // Join existing room
  leaveRoom,          // Leave current room
  toggleReady,        // Toggle ready status
  startGame,          // Start game (host only)
  isConnected,        // Connection status
  canStartGame        // Whether game can be started
} = useMultiplayerGame();
```

### Utility Functions

#### **multiplayerUtils** (`src/utils/multiplayerUtils.ts`)
Comprehensive utilities for multiplayer operations:
- Room code generation and validation
- Avatar color management
- Multiplayer scoring with time bonuses
- Leaderboard calculations
- Display name validation
- Guest name generation
- Submission progress tracking

### Type System

#### **Multiplayer Types** (`src/types/multiplayer.ts`)
Complete TypeScript type definitions:
- Core interfaces for rooms, participants, sessions, results
- Real-time event types for WebSocket communication
- UI state management types
- Game mode presets with configuration
- Constants for multiplayer limits and timing

## Game Modes

### 1. Classic Mode
- 5 rounds, 60 seconds each
- Standard scoring system

## Real-time Communication

### Supabase Realtime Channels
Three dedicated channels per room:
1. **Room Channel** (`room:${roomId}`): Participant management
2. **Game Channel** (`game:${sessionId}`): Gameplay events
3. **Chat Channel** (`chat:${roomId}`): Future chat functionality

### Event Types
- `player_joined` / `player_left`: Participant changes
- `player_ready`: Ready status updates

- `round_started` / `round_ended`: Round management
- `game_ended`: Final results

### Database Change Tracking
Real-time updates via PostgreSQL change tracking:
- Room participant additions/removals
- Room status changes
- Session updates
- Round result submissions

## Security Features

### Authentication
